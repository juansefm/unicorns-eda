# Code for "6 things you need to know" blog
[Blog post here](https://medium.com/@juansefm/the-6-facts-you-need-to-know-about-unicorns-18beb4c4559d)

## Packages required
* Standard Anaconda installation packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* [WBGAPI](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/introducing-wbgapi-new-python-package-accessing-world-bank-data): A package used to retrieve datasets from the World Bank's World Development Indicators.  
## Project motivation
In this analysis, we will try to understand better some of the main characteristics of companies that have achieved valuations above 1 billion.

In particular, we will try to answer the following questions:

* How many unicorns are there?
* How has the number of unicorns evolved over the last years?
* What are the countries that produce the highest number of unicorns?
* What are the countries that actually have more unicorns?
* What are the industries that historically raise the most unicorns?
* How many years does it take to become a unicorn?


## Conclusions
We find the following results:

* 1,037 companies reached unicorn status in the last 20 years.
* There was a sensational surge in the number of unicorn valuation events in 2021, most likely due to the high liquidity of financial markets.
* US, China, and India put most of the unicorns of the herd.
* However, Israel, Singapore, and the US have the most unicorns per capita.
* Fintech and internet software industries have raised most of the unicorns. Moreover, the hot industries have changed in the last decade, as interest in mobile banking and crypto-assets skyrocketed.
* On average, it takes 7.6 years to become a unicorn, but some achieve it 10 or 20 years after creation.
